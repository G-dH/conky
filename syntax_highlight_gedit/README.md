`conky.lang` have to be placed in one of the following directories (at least in Ubuntu), depending on used gtksourceview version:

The newest versions 4:

    /usr/share/gtksourceview-4/language-specs/
    ~/.local/share/gtksourceview-4/language-specs/

Older versions 3:

    /usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs/
    ~/.local/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs/

Ancient versions 2:

    /usr/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs/
    ~/.local/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs/


variables/keywords list might be incomplete, I made it 10 years ago.
