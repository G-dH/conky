*conky.lang* have to be placed in one of the following directories (at least in Ubuntu), depending on Gedit/Gnome version:
The newest 3 versions:
 /usr/share/gtksourceview-4/language-specs/
 ~/.local/share/gtksourceview-4/language-specs/
Older 3 versions:
 /usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs/
 ~/.local/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs/
Gnome 2:
 /usr/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs/
 ~/.local/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs/


variables/keywords list might be incomplete, I made it 10 years ago.
